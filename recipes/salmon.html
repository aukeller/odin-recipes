        <h1>Maple-Glazed Salmon with Pineapple</h1>
        <img src="../img/salmon.jpg">
        
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Broiled salmon is incredibly moist and tender and perfect for a weeknight meal. 
        </p>
        <p>The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the salmon; I suggest checking for doneness after 10 minutes.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons maple syrup, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce (such as Bragg)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) skin-on center-cut salmon fillets</li>
            <li>Â¼ teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>1 serving cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 slices fresh pineapple, halved</li>
            <li>2 wedges lemon</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 2 tablespoons maple syrup, soy sauce, lemon juice, and ginger in a bowl. Place salmon into the marinade and turn to coat. Marinate for at least 15 minutes, but no longer than 30.
            </li>
            <li>For the glaze, mix remaining 2 tablespoons maple syrup and Cajun seasoning together in a bowl. Set aside until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to low.</li>
            <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and lightly spray with cooking spray. Remove the salmon from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Place salmon, skin side-down, and pineapple, onto the sheet and brush with the glaze.</li>
            <li>Broil in the preheated oven until salmon easily flakes with a fork and reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (62 degrees C), 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
