        <p>This lemon-shrimp pasta is quick, lemony, and a very merry light dish!  

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces penne pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup red bell pepper strips</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic</li>
            <li>½ pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon lemon zest, or more to taste</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside.

            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add red pepper strips and garlic; cook until peppers are tender and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Add shrimp and lemon juice; stir constantly until shrimp turn bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 4 to 6 minutes. Add cooked pasta and lemon zest and toss lightly to coat. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and parsley.</li>
